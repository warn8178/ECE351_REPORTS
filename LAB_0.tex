\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item What did you do over the summer?
   \begin{itemize}
     \item I worked an Internship at Avista, designing customer projects for the Customer Project Coordinators. Basically if someone needed a new electric service, we figured out how to get the electricity to their business or house and how to accommodate the new load.

   \end{itemize}
   \item What do you personally want to get out of this lab?
    \begin{itemize}
     \item I want to become proficient in coding python, as well as become familiar with GitHub so I can take these skills to the job force. I would also like to become more proficient in LaTex.

   \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
